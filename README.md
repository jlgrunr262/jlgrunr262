ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **Jerry Gentry**
Iâ€™ve spent my career in IT and am constantly learning. Although I started out engineering core infrastructure for network, compute and storage, I have been _in leadership for over 20 years_ with ever increasing responsibilities and scope. I've looked back at my career and decided to learn to code and investigate pentestsing. I've always done a little bit of coding, but never with any proficiency. What attracts me is the problem solving nature of coding. Although I have familiarity with a few languages, I feel python has a simpler syntax and will allow me to concentrate more on the logic of coding. In my job cyber security is a focus area, so learning to pentest will provide me insights for architecture and engineering. 

I am open to collaborating on many topics. I am also a writer.  My novel "SYN:FIN" is available on Amazon.
